# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This github repository contains the final submission for the peer graded assingment.
This includes an .R script file, the .txt file and a codebook.md

1. The "run_analysis.R" script contains step by step code that will help us generate tidy data sets based on our specific preference of variables.
  
  The main steps of this process is as follows:
    a. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    b. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    c. Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    d. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
    e. Based on the last data set, creating another independent data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
    
 2. This Repository contains a CodeBook.md file:
    contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information
    
 3. The FinalData.txt file is the new data set which contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject, generated using the "Mean_SD_extract" data set.
